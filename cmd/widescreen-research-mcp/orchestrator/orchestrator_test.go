// MockGCP is a mock implementation of the GCP clients.
// For a real-world test, you would use libraries like "faux-gcp" or emulators.
// For this context, we will not be implementing a full mock.
// This test will serve as a structural placeholder.

func TestOrchestrateResearch_E2E_Placeholder(t *testing.T) {
	// This test is a placeholder to demonstrate the structure of an end-to-end
	// integration test for the orchestrator. A full implementation would require
	// extensive mocking of GCP services (Cloud Run, Pub/Sub, Firestore) and
	// an HTTP test server to simulate the drones.

	// Setup:
	// 1. Initialize mock GCP clients.
	// 2. Initialize an Orchestrator instance with the mock clients.
	// 3. Start an httptest.Server to simulate the drone fleet. This server
	//    would receive instructions and publish mock results to the mock Pub/Sub.
	// 4. Define a test ResearchConfig.

	// Execution:
	// - Call orchestrator.OrchestrateResearch(ctx, config)

	// Assertions:
	// 1. Check that the function returns no error.
	// 2. Check that the final ResearchResult is correct.
	// 3. Read the progress file and verify its contents at various stages.
	// 4. Read the final report file and verify its contents.
	// 5. Check that the individual drone result JSON files were created.
	// 6. Assert that the mock GCP functions (e.g., deployDrone) were called
	//    the correct number of times.

	// Mark the test as skipped because it's a placeholder.
